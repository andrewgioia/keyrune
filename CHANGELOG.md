# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

* Update ONC once official, higher resolution image comes out.
* Support apparent "tri-layered" symbols, like SNC and CBL where there's a rarity layer, a fixed white layer, and a border. These are unlike the dual-layered symbols like AFR and MID.
* Validate all class names to handle official set codes, MODO codes, and MTGJson/community fallbacks
* Update this changelog for better formatting 
* Review DSK and FDN SVG files to make sure they're single layer, and update docs if needed

#### Changed

* All Alchemy aliases are now available ([#271](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/271))


### [3.16.1] 2024-12-12 Tarkir: Dragonstorm

#### Added

* Pioneer Masters (PIO) set symbol ([#249](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/249))
* Preliminary icon for the Tarkir: Dragonstorm (TDM) set symbol; this will be replaced when the official one comes out ([#250](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/250))
* Aetherdrift Commander (DRC) set symbol with inner and border glyphs ([#251](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/251))
* SVGs are now up to date and the improper scale of DSK and MB2 is corrected ([#260](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/260))

#### Changed

* REN and RIN are now added as set codes and class names for Renaissance and Rinascimento, respectively. Previously these were `xren` and `xrin`, which are maintained for backwards compatibility, but they now have the "official" MTGJSON/Scryfall codes.

#### Fixed

* Re-adds support for text-stroke borders by default, and manual glyph borders as an override on specific symbols. Note that .ss-border is not working well when .ss-grad is also applied, due to the way that the gradient has to be applied to the glyph (via text-clip).


### [3.16.0] 2024-10-28 Aetherdrift

#### Added

* Aetherdrift (DFT) set symbol ([#248](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/248))
* Innistrad Remastered (INR) set symbol ([#248](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/248))
* Foundations Commander (FDC) set symbol ([#223](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/233))

#### Changed

* Commander 2016 (C16) previously used the inner rarity layer as the monochrome/default set symbol. This unfortunately lost the sword pommel and much of the set symbols character, as WOTC uses nonstandard rarity/border styles for symbol images. The border is now the default monochrome set symbol and the symbol is now a dual-layered one with rarity as a separate glyph. ([#246](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/246))

#### Fixed

* Y23 and Y24 were in the font but now are documented ([#247](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/247))
* Y23 alias added for YDMU
* Cheatsheet now has better icon font rendering so things don't look so dark

#### Removed

* `.ss-border` has been removed after realizing 1. it wasn't functional for non-duo symbols and 2. it wasn't the correct way to do it anyway. Better automatica border support for non-duo symbols coming soon.

### [3.15.1] 2024-10-26 DSC, Y25, J25, and come cleanup

#### Added

* Duskmourn Commander set symbol (DSC) (Uses changes from [#244](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/pull/244). There was an issue with the assets that made it easier just to manually pull them in, plus this version includes the multilayer style with inner layer handling.
* Alchemy 2025 (Y25) set symbol, with alias for Alchemy Bloomburror (YBLB) ([#231](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/231))
* Jumpstart 2025 (J25) set symbol ([#236](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/236)). This one suffers from most of the border adding to the set symbol itself and will be much better handled in v4, but for now we're shipping a "modified" version by default to convey the border as well as an alternate `.j25a` true to the rarity layer.

#### Fixed

* Moved FDN up to Core Sets in documentation
* BLB unicode corrected in icons documentation ([#244](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/pull/244))

### [3.7.0] 2020-09-02 2021 symbols and new dual-layered support!

This is a big update with all of the recently announced 2021 sets (major thanks to @csuhta and @scryfall). This also begins support for the dual-layered symbols (like M21, though that hasn't been fixed yet) where the border and fill are 2 separate layers.

* **Added:** Modern Horizons 2 (MH2) ([#136](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/136))
* **Added:** Zendikar Rising Expeditions (ZNE) ([#142](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/142))
* **Added:** Time Spiral Remastered (TSR) ([#138](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/138))
* **Added:** Kaldheim (preliminary code xKLD) ([#139](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/139))

* **Added:** new support for 2 dual-layered symbols, xDND and xIN4. Now if you add `.ss-duo` to these symboles they'll use the border glyph to properly represent these print layers (where the inner is the gradient/colorized portion and the border is black or white) (partly addressing [#119](https://github.com/andrewgioia/keyrune/issues/119))

### [3.6.8] 2020-08-28 Adds all missing SVGs
